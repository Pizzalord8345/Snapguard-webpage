# SnapGuard Website

This is the static informational website for the SnapGuard project.  
It consists of a single `index.html` file and is hosted via GitHub Pages.

## Purpose

The site provides a basic overview of the SnapGuard snapshot management tool, including its features, philosophy, and links to the main repository.

## How to Contribute

You can edit the `index.html` file directly if you'd like to improve the content or layout.

No build tools or dependencies are required â€” it's pure HTML.
